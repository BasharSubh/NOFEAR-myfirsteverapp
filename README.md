# myfirst-everapp
Visual Basic - My first ever app was devil little bit back in 2008 :) 
have a timer for 10second if you don't write the password "brs" it will start copy itself literally everywhere till the date 25 oct every year
it will delete all files in the harddisk , 
every time user robot the pc it will give another chance to write the password "brs" if the user insert the password, 
its will stop and remove itself and fix what ever mades in the system
