# Visual Basic: My First Application (2008)
## Introduction
Back in 2008, I created my first-ever application using Visual Basic. This application, nicknamed "NoFear," had a unique functionality that challenged users to prevent it from causing chaos on their system.

## Functionality
Upon launching, the application presents the user with a 10-second timer. The user must enter the correct password, "brs", within this timeframe. If the user fails to provide the correct password, the application initiates a series of actions:

- The application begins to copy itself to various locations on the system.
- Every year on October 25th, it deletes all files on the hard disk.
- Each time the user reboots their computer, the application provides another opportunity to enter the "brs" password.
If the user enters the correct password at any point, the application stops its actions, removes itself from the system, and automatically attempts to repair any damage it has caused.

## Additional Information
This project was developed using Visual Basic, a programming language and integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft. Visual Basic allows developers to create Windows applications with ease, making it a popular choice for beginners.
